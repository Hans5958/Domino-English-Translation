Domino is a MIDI editor that is used for creating MIDI songs/musics. Domino is used by various blackers in the Black MIDI ecosystem.

Since Domino is an abandonware, and it's original language is Japanese, many people tried to translate it using resource editing tools. Some of it are outdated, while others are incomplete.

This repository is made to unify the translations made by community, while trying to complete it for easier usage.

## Usage

1. Download either the Domino ``.zip`` or the ``.exe``.  
    - The ``.zip`` contains everything you need to run Domino. __Download this if you are not sure or this is your first time using this program.__  
    - You can also download the ``.exe`` if you want to use your configured settings. Place it inside your Domino directly, where "``Domino.exe``" placed.

2. Run the executable.
    - If you downloaded the .zip, just run ``Domino.exe``.
    - If you downloaded the .exe, after placing it on the directory, run ``Domino_Translated.exe`` (make sure you rename it so you know which one's the new version!).

## Contributing

You can contribute by translating the ``.rc`` files. The ``.rc`` files contains the most of the program's strings. Some of it are translated, so check the checklist below first to know which one's is not translated. 

You can also execute ``compile.sh`` if you want the ``.exe`` versions of it, and it will be placed inside the ``_compile`` folder. Just make sure you have Resoure Hacker and Windows Subsystem for Linux installed.
