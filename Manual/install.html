	<h3><a name="inst">Installing</a></h3>
	<div class=w>
		All you need to do is extract the software from the archive.
	</div>
	<h3><a name="verup">Updating</a></h3>
	<div class=w>
		If you have not modified or added any Sound Source Definition Files, extract the latest version and overwrite all files to the old version folder.<br>
		<br>
		If you have, launch the old version first and click "Export Preferences" from the "File" menu.<br>
		Then, on the new version, you can import the settings by clicking "Import Preferences" from the "File" menu.
	</div>
	<h3><a name="uninst">Uninstalling</a></h3>
	<div class=w>
		It doesn't use the registry, so you can just delete the Domino folder.
	</div>
	<h3><a name="port">Port Settings (important)</a></h3>
	<div class=w>
		When you start Domino for the first time, you first need to set the MIDI port.<br>
		Click the "Preferences" button on the toolbar to open the "Preferences" screen.<br>
		<img src="assets/inst_000.png" width="177" height="74"><br>
		<br>
		Click "MIDI-OUT" on the left to display the current output port settings screen.<br>
		<img src="assets/inst_001.png" width="704" height="420"><br>
		<br>
		For the time being, click the MIDI device part of the A port and select the MIDI device you want to use.<br>
		<img src="assets/inst_002.png" width="312" height="166"><br>
		<br>
		Next, click the "Sound Source Used" part of the A port and select the Sound Source (Sound Source Definition File) connected to the MIDI device you selected earlier.<br>
		<img src="assets/inst_003.png" width="299" height="173"><br>
		<br>
		<div class=caution>
			If you don't have an external sound source and don't know what to set, you can use "Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth" as the MIDI-OUT device for port A and "GSm (Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth)" respectively. (Please leave the port B as it is.)
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class=caution>
			Although it is easy to miss, the sound source "SC-8850" or "GM Level 1" is not automatically attached to the Domino.<br>
			<br>
			* "SC-8850" is a hardware sound source released by Roland.<br>
			Product information: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140904084658/http://www.roland.co.jp/products/dtm/SC-8850.html">http://www.roland.co.jp/products/dtm/SC-8850.html</a></li>
		</div>
		<br>
		If the Sound Source that you want to use does not exist, you can solve it by following these methods.
		<ul>
			<li>Find the Sound Source Definition File from <a href="http://takabosoft.com/domino/module">the collection on the official website</a>.
			<li>Make your own. (refer to "<a href="module.html">Sound Source Definition File Specifications</a>")
			<li><s>Make a request with the subject "please create the definition file of the sound source"</s><br>(If you don't have the sound source, you cannot create it's definition file, so I think it is best to make it yourself.)
		</ul>
		<br>
		If you want to use more than 16 channels, or if you want to use multiple sources at the same time,
		do the same for ports B and up.<br>
		<br>
		If you have a MIDI keyboard, select "MIDI-IN" on the left and set the MIDI-IN device for that MIDI keyboard.<br>
		<img src="assets/inst_004.png" width="631" height="226"><br>
		<br>
		Preparation is now complete.<br>
