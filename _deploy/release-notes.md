No significant updates for the translation for this one, but it's related to the backstage.

I have added `readme-translation.txt` for explaining the program and to give links, since there are some people who uploaded the program without linking the repo because they forgot about it.

Starting now, the versions on the binaries (``.exe``) will be updated for each release. This will reduce some confusion on users. You can see this by right-click the binary, click "Properties", and click the "Details" tab. The file version will only list the build number, while the product version will list both the build number and the nightly date.

There are now nightly releases that has new translation each time I update it. This release is one of them. The complete release for each version/build will also be uploaded sooner or later. If there are no updates on the strings, it will be uploaded as an artifact, which you can check on the latest deployment on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation/actions/).

I have changed the CI from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for the nightly releases, and, for the future, checking the  pull requests before merging it.

[The readme on the repository](https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation/blob/master/README.md) has been updated for new users who wanted to use the program or contributing to the project.

That's all for this release, thanks for reading.
