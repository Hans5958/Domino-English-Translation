In this pre-release, I added more files to be translated, as per rjyren's (@ryryjy) request. The parts that I added are as follows.

- Manual (all files)
- Module (all .xml files)
- System (.txt files only)
- readme.txt (on the "Other" folder)

Also, I have done some changes on the manual folder so it looks nice. All assets have been put inside a single folder, the HTML files are tidied up, and the encoding has been changed from Shift-JIS to UTF-8. The manual still works, thankfully. If anyone wanted the manual on the web, let me know.

The compilation process have been changed a little bit, so keep in mind. The CI is untested, however. Hopefully it works. If you can see this release, that means it works.

If you aren't noticed yet, there are no new translation on this one, but I heard rjyren (@ryryjy) and Khang (@khang06) are doing it. So, stay tuned, I guess.
