Here's an update after a while. This project now supports translation for version 1.44, and others future versions. 

I have added some strings, as well as a revamp on the build scripts, which now placed on the `_scripts` folder. You can either run `build-1.43.sh` or `build-1.44.sh` for versions 1.43 and 1.44 respectively.

This version should ready for release as it is, but I still need to test things and probably make some other changes before pushing the release version.

Oh, yeah. The file names for this and future releases have been changed. Keep that in mind.
